I mainly want to learn about web spider using Python.But, nothing to crawl.Anyway, the 1024 website is a good example.

# Configure

Use `image.py` as a example, it is a spider to crawl images of 1024.

1. Modify the `DIR_PATH` in line 14.
2. Find a useful url of 1024 and modify `URL` in line 17.

Then, you can enjoy it.

#  Installation

1024Spider is depended on Pysipder.
Pyspider: https://github.com/binux/pyspider

You can install Pyspider firstly and then create a project on WebUI. Copy  my code into it.

If you need more infomation, please read the Pyspider docment.
